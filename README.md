# DSA Algo Vault

Welcome to my **DSA Algo Vault** â€“ a structured repository containing my solutions, approaches, and code snippets for core Data Structures and Algorithms problems.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This repository serves as my personal revision vault to:

- Reinforce core DSA concepts for upcoming technical interviews.
- Maintain clean, optimal, and readable solutions.
- Track structured progress across all fundamental topics and contests

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Patterns**: Contains various pattern generation scripts in Python, each generating a specific pattern based on user input, typically involving numbers or stars arranged in a particular format.
